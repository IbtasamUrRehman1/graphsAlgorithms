**Graph Algorithms Repository**
This repository showcases a collection of essential graph algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. From graph representation to shortest path calculations and visualization, this repository serves as a resource for understanding and applying graph theory concepts in computer science.

**Features**
 - **Graph Representations:** Implementations using adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.
 - **Shortest Path Algorithms:** Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, and specialized algorithms for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
 - **Graph Operations:** Includes graph coloring, Eulerian path visualization, and topological sorting.
 - **Visualization:** Tools to visualize graphs and their properties using Python libraries.

**Getting Started**
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.
